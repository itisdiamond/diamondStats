\title{Skewness and Kurtosis (with Classification)}
\usage{
SkewKurt_diamond(x, data = NULL, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector, or a formula of the form \code{numeric_var ~ group_var}.}

\item{data}{Optional data frame in which to evaluate the variables in \code{x}.}

\item{na.rm}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), missing values are removed before computation.}
}
\value{
If a numeric vector is provided, returns a named list with skewness, skewness classification, kurtosis, and kurtosis classification.
If a formula is provided, returns a data.frame with results per group.
}
\description{
Computes skewness and kurtosis (with interpretation) for a numeric vector or, using a formula, for each group of a factor.
}
\details{
Skewness and kurtosis are computed using \code{DescTools::Skew} and \code{DescTools::Kurt}.
Interpretation follows these thresholds:
\itemize{
\item Severely negative: < -2
\item Moderately negative: < -1
\item Slightly negative: < -0.5
\item Approximately normal: -0.5 to 0.5
\item Slightly positive: <= 1
\item Moderately positive: <= 2
\item Severely positive: > 2
}
}
\examples{
SkewKurt_diamond(mtcars$mpg)
SkewKurt_diamond(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
